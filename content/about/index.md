Hello, I'm Pedro Gabriel P, a seasoned software engineer with over 15 years of experience in driving technological innovation and delivering high-impact software solutions across various industries, including e-commerce, fintech, and web3.

My journey in software engineering has been marked by significant achievements:
- Designed and led the development of a high-performance order matching engine.
- Developed a comprehensive system for buying, selling, and exchanging digital assets for a Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) fintech.
- Created a high-performance payment switch for a fintech startup.

I'm deeply passionate about the web3 space, particularly within the Solana ecosystem. My expertise in Rust, Go, Python, Redis, Kubernetes, and AWS has enabled me to build robust and scalable solutions. Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge in machine learning and artificial intelligence to further innovate and disrupt the industry.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, sharing my knowledge through blogging, and collaborating with like-minded professionals. Let's connect and create something impactful together!
